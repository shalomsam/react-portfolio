        <p>
            Bluehost is a US-based hosting company. This website was built on PHP, as part of an in-house CMS platform, called Supersite<a href="http://manage.bigrock.in/kb/servlet/KBServlet/faq783.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(?)</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            My roles involved porting the .COM site (US), building the website from scratch and integrating it into our backend CMS system, Supersite<a href="http://manage.bluehost.in/kb/servlet/KBServlet/faq783.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">(?)</a> and our billing system OrderBox<a href="https://www.logicboxes.com/orderbox/" target="_blank">(?)</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            I was also tasked with similarly building the China (.CN) version of the site.
            My role also involved maintaining these sites, which included timely updates/feature additions (frontend + backend), code reviews, bug testing, refactoring and bug fixing.
