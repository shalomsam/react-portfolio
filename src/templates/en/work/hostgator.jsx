            Hostgator is a leading US-based hosting company. This web application was built on PHP, as part of an in-house CMS tool called Supersite<a href="http://manage.hostgator.in/kb/servlet/KBServlet/faq783.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">(?)</a>.
            <br/><br/>
            My role involved building the website from scratch and integrating it into the in-house CMS, <a href="http://manage.hostgator.in/kb/servlet/KBServlet/faq783.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Supersite (v2)</a>. I also was tasked with building replicas for .CN (China) and .MY (Malayasian) markets. 
            <br/><br/>
            My role also involved maintenance and management of these sites, including timely updates/feature additions, code reviews, refactoring and bug fixes.
