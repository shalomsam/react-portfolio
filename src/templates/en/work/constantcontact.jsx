        <p>
            ConstantContact is one of the leading Email Marketing tools/service providers. I was involved in this project right from its conceptualization, to ideating and providing UI/UX inputs during design, to building the single page website/app (frontend + backend) from scratch.
            <br/><br/>
            This also involved conceptualization of architectural and complete workflow from git commit to automated builds(in grunt/bash) and deployments on staging(development server) and/or production through tools such as bamboo.
            <br/><br/>
            My workflow also involved the website/apps integration with our in-house billing platform Orderbox<a href="https://www.logicboxes.com/orderbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(?)</a> through provided HTTP APIs.
            <br/><br/>
            The front end was built using HTML/CSS and Angularjs as the javascript library. And the backend was written in PHP, with Laravel as the chosen framework. This project used an internal PHP library/SDK<a href="#phpsdk">(?)</a> that was also built by me as a wrapper for the OrderBox APIs.
            <br/><br/>
            I was responsible for all analytics implementation. I chose to use GTM due to its flexibility and advised the team on its merits. I was responsible for the complete GTM + GA (and other analytics platforms) end to end integrations including e-commerce tracking.
            <br/><br/>
            My workflow also involved timely code-reviews, refactoring, debugging, testing and bug fixing.
